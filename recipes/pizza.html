    <h2>What is Margherita Pizza</h2>
    <p>Margherita pizza is a classic Italian dish that embodies simplicity and freshness. It features a thin, crispy crust topped with a vibrant tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, and fragrant spices.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: Balsamic glaze for drizzling</li>
    </ul>  
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) or as high as it will go.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer it to a pizza stone or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Tomato Sauce:</strong> Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer with Cheese:</strong> Place slices of fresh mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Basil:</strong> Tear fresh basil leaves and scatter them over the cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Season:</strong> Drizzle olive oil over the top and season with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish:</strong> Remove from the oven and let it cool for a minute. Optionally, drizzle with balsamic glaze before slicing.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Slice and enjoy your homemade Margherita pizza!</li>
