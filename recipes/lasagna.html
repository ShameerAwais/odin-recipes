<h2>What is Lasagna</h2>
<p1>Lasagna is a rich, layered Italian dish known for its hearty and comforting nature. It consists of broad, flat pasta sheets stacked between generous layers of savory fillings, typically including a seasoned meat or vegetable sauce and creamy cheese. Each layer adds to its depth, both in texture and flavor, creating a balanced combination of softness, richness, and slight crispness on top when baked.</p1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1 bell pepper, diced</li>
    <li>1 onion, diced</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

    <li>6 ounces tomato paste</li>
    <li>14.5 ounces crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>

    <li>Olive oil for cooking</li>
    <li>Fresh basil for garnish (optional)</li>

    <li>Cooking spray or additional olive oil for greasing the baking dish</li>
    <li>Aluminum foil for covering the dish while baking</li>
    <li>Parmesan cheese for topping (optional)</li>
    <li>Fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
    <li>Cooking utensils: large skillet, pot for boiling noodles, baking dish, mixing
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<p1>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down:</p1>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Start by making the sauce </strong>with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. </strong>We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesanâ€”like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
    <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job. </strong>A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>
</ol>
